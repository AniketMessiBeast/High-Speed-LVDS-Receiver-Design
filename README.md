# High-Speed-LVDS-Receiver-Design

**Low-Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS)** is a high-speed data transmission technology that uses differential signals to transmit information over twisted-pair copper cables. It operates at low voltages, typically around 1.2V, to reduce power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI), making it ideal for high-speed communication in electronic devices. LVDS is widely used in applications such as computer displays, high-definition video, and data communication links where high bandwidth and low noise are critical.

## Problem Statement
Design and implement a generic high-speed LVDS receiver input stage operating for transients upto 500Mbps to 1Gbps.
